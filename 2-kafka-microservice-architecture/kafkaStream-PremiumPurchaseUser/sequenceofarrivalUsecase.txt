This will takes premium purchase and premium
user as input, and returns premium offer

The blue purchase stream
and red user table.



At first sequence, we set user level.

46

Bruce has bronze level, and Clark is gold.

47

Alfred does not has any level.

48

On sequence 2, Bruce made purchase number
21.

49

Since Bruce current level is bronze, it is
not considered as premium offer, no join record

50

happened.

51

On sequence 3, Clark made purchase number
31.

52

Join record happened for 31, because clark
level is gold

53

On 4th sequence, we update Bruce level to
gold.

54

Since stream-table join is asymmetric, purchase
21 on sequence 2 does not form join record.

55

On sequence 5, Bruce made purchase number
22.

56

At this point, Bruce level is gold, so join
record happened for this purchase

57

On sequence 6, Alfred made purchase number
11.

58

No join happened, since alfred has no level

59

On sequence 7, Clark level downgraded to silver

60

So, Clark purchase number 32, on sequence
8 does not form join record, since his level

61

is currently silver.

62

However, Bruce purchase number 23 on sequence
9 form join record, since we only change Clark

63

level, but Bruce level remains gold.

64

On sequence 10, we downgrade Bruce level to
silver.

65

So, Bruce purchase number 24 on sequence 11
does not form join record.

66

As well as Clark purchase on sequence 12,
because Clark level is silver.

67

On sequence 13, we upgrade Alfred level to
gold, and Clark level to diamond

68

So clark purchase number 34 in sequence 14
will form join record.

69

However, Alfred purchase number 11 does not
form join record, since that purchase happened

67
before we upgrade Alfred level.
